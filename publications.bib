abstract = {Understanding the structure of a scientific domain and extracting specific information from it is laborious. The high amount of manual effort required to this end indicates that the way knowledge has been structured and visualized until the present day should be improved in software tools. Nowadays, scientific domains are organized based on citation networks or bag-of-words techniques, disregarding the intrinsic semantics of concepts presented in literature documents. We propose a novel approach to structure scientific fields, which uses semantic analysis from natural language texts to construct knowledge graphs. Then, our approach clusters knowledge graphs in their main topics and automatically extracts information such as the most relevant concepts in topics and overlapping concepts between topics. We evaluate the proposed model in two datasets from distinct areas. The results achieve up to 84% of accuracy in the task of document classification without using annotated data to segment topics from a set of input documents. Our solution identifies coherent keyphrases and key concepts considering the dataset used. The SciKGraph framework contributes by structuring knowledge that might aid researchers in the study of their areas, reducing the effort and amount of time devoted to groundwork.}

abstract = { The process of tracking the evolution of a scientific field is arduous. It allows researchers to understand trends in areas of science and predict how they may evolve. Nowadays, most of the automated mechanisms developed to assist researchers in this process do not consider the content of articles to identify changes in its structure, only the articles metadata. These methods are not suited to easily assist researchers to study the concepts that compose an area and its evolution. In this article, we propose a method to track the evolution of a scientific field at a concept level. Our method structures a scientific field using two knowledge graphs, representing distinct periods of the studied field. Then, it clusters them and identifies correspondent clusters between the knowledge graphs, representing the same subareas in distinct time periods. Our solution enables to compare the corresponding clusters, tracking their evolution. We apply and experiment our method in two case studies concerning the artificial intelligence (AI) and the biotechnology (BIO) fields. Findings indicate befitting results regarding the way their evolution can be assessed with our implemented software tool. From our analyses, we perceived evolution in broader subareas of a scientific field, as the growth of the ‘Convolutional Neural Network’ area from 2006; to specific ones, as the decrease of research works using mice to study BRAF-mutation lung cancer from 2018. This work contributes with the development of a web application with interactive user interfaces to assist researchers in representing, analysing and tracking the evolution of scientific fields at a concept level. }

abstract="Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying a set of phrases that best represent a natural language document. It is a fundamental and challenging task that assists publishers to index and recommend relevant documents to readers. In this article, we introduce C-Rank, a novel unsupervised approach to automatically extract keyphrases from single documents by using concept linking. Our method explores Babelfy to identify candidate keyphrases, which are weighted based on heuristics and their centrality inside a co-occurrence graph where keyphrases appear as vertices. It improves the results obtained by graph-based techniques without training nor background data inserted by users. Evaluations are performed on SemEval and INSPEC datasets, producing competitive results with state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, C-Rank generates intermediate structures with semantically annotated data that can be used to analyze larger textual compendiums, which might improve domain understatement and enrich textual representation methods.",

abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have drawn academy and industry attention for their ability to represent and solve complex problems. Researchers are studying how to distribute their computation to reduce their training time. However, the most common approaches in this direction are synchronous, letting computational resources sub-utilized. Asynchronous training does not have this drawback but is impacted by staled gradient updates, which have not been extended researched yet. Considering this, we experimentally investigate how stale gradients affect the convergence time and loss value of an ANN. In particular, we analyze an asynchronous distributed implementation of a Word2Vec model, in which the impact of staleness is negligible and can be ignored considering the computational speedup we achieve by allowing the staleness.},

abstract = { The keyphrase extraction task is a fundamental and challenging task designed to extract a set of keyphrases from textual documents. Keyphrases are essential to assist publishers in indexing documents and readers in identifying the most relevant ones. They are short phrases composed of one or more terms used to represent a textual document and its main topics. In this article, we extend our research on C-Rank, which is an unsupervised approach that automatically extracts keyphrases from single documents. C-Rank uses concept-linking to link concepts in common between single documents and an external background knowledge base. We advance our study over C-Rank by evaluating it using different concept-linking approaches - Babelfy and DBPedia Spotlight. We evaluated C-Rank on data sets composed of academic articles, academic abstracts, and news articles. Our findings indicate that C-Rank achieves state-of-the-art results extracting keyphrases from scientific documents by experimentally comparing it to existing unsupervised approaches. }

abstract = {Learning non use-case specific models has been shown to be a challenging task in Deep Learning (DL). Hyperparameter tuning requires long training sessions that have to be restarted any time the network or the dataset changes and are not affordable by most stakeholders in industry and research. Many attempts have been made to justify and understand the source of the use-case specificity that distinguishes DL problems. To this date, second-order optimization methods have been partially shown to be effective in some cases but have not been sufficiently investigated in the context of learning and optimization. In this work, we present a chain rule for the efficient approximation of the Hessian matrix (i.e., the second-order derivatives) of the weights across the layers of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show the application of our approach for weight optimization during DNN training, as we believe that this is a step that particularly suffers from the enormous variety of the optimizers provided by state-of-the-art libraries such as Keras and PyTorch. We demonstrate—both theoretically and empirically—the improved accuracy of our approximation technique and that the Hessian is a useful diagnostic tool which helps to more rigorously optimize training. Our preliminary experiments prove the efficiency as well as the improved convergence of our approach which both are crucial aspects for DNN training.},
